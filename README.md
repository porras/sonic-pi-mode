# sonic-pi-mode

A minor mode to send code to [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) from an Emacs buffer (so that you can live code in Emacs).

I wrote after a failed attempt to fix [sonic-pi.el](https://github.com/repl-electric/sonic-pi.el) (which is broken in Sonic Pi 4.x due to multiple changes in its API). It is much more modest a feature-poor in comparison though: just send code (which means no logs, no feedback on errors, no autocomplete other than the Ruby one, etc.).

_After writing it_ I understand the problem better, so I may be able to fix the original mode now, and I'll probably try to do that at some point. In the meantime, here is this code that Works On My Machine (tm).

## Requirements

* A working and *running* install of Sonic Pi 4.x. *Running* means you should manually launch it before attempting to connect from Emacs
* The [`osc`](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/osc.html) Emacs package. Not sure which version is required ðŸ™„

## Installation

I might consider to submit this package to MELPA, but for now you have to install it from this repository, in the way your package manager allows it. If you need to do it manually, clone this repo and add this to your `init.el`:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/<your-local-copy>")
(require 'sonic-pi-mode)
```

## Usage

<kbd>M-x</kbd> `sonic-pi-mode` to enable the following commands (with a default keybinding):

| Keybinding       | Command                |                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>C-c r</kbd> | `sonic-pi-send-buffer` | Sends the contents of the current buffer to the running Sonic Pi. It automatically establishes the connection if it wasn't previously connected               |
| <kbd>C-c s</kbd> | `sonic-pi-stop`        | Sends a `stop-all-jobs` command to the running Sonic Pi (equivalent to <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> on Sonic Pi)                                                          |
| <kbd>C-c d</kbd> | `sonic-pi-disconnect`  | Closes the current connection to Sonic Pi, if any. It can be useful to reset the connection if it becomes unresponsive (for example, if you restart Sonic Pi) |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Better error feedback when it's not possible to connect to Sonic Pi (because it's not running, or any other problem).
- [ ] Manage the launch of the Sonic Pi daemon instead of relying on it being running.
- [ ] Get logs back from Sonic Pi and display them on a buffer.
- [ ] Attempt to contribute all this back to [sonic-pi.el](https://github.com/repl-electric/sonic-pi.el) on a backwards-compatible way (so that it works with both Sonic Pi 3 and 4).
